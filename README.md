# CSI300_Project2_steveaul

Basically, you need to install MAMP and clone this repository (steveaul) into the "htdocs" folder in MAMP. (so it'll look like C:\MAMP\htdocs\steveaul)
Then in MAMP, go to Preferences > Web Server, change the path to "steveaul".    

To install the Twitter database:
- Open phpMyAdmin, then create a new database called 'twitter'
- In the sql tab, paste the code from create_database (omit the schema creation, start with USE Twitter ; )
- Click go!
